## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive exploration of selected topics from *Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications* by Kenneth Rosen. I focused on the computer programs from Chapters 3 and 6. The goal of this project was to research, extend, and apply concepts from discrete mathematics to interactive visualizations. This project includes visualizations for permutations, combinations, lexicographical ordering, and sorting/searching algorithms. The project is designed to help students learn and apply concepts in a way that goes beyond textbook examples. 

## Project Goals

Through this project, I aimed to:
- Develop interactive simulations for key discrete mathematics algorithms.
- Visualize algorithm execution to enhance understanding.
- Apply discrete mathematics knowledge to a practical web-based tool.
- Create a professional and accessible platform for peers to learn from.
- Explore efficiency, optimization, and algorithm behavior through visual feedback.

The project is presented as an interactive web application with responsive design, allowing users to input data, run simulations, and observe real-time algorithm steps. This combines computer programming with discrete mathematics theory, providing a hands-on learning experience.
